# STORAGE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM : OPERATING SYSTEM


 Memory allocation is a process by which computer programs and services are assigned with physical or virtual memory space.


 Segmentation is another memory management scheme that supports the user-view of memory. 

 Segmentation allows breaking of the virtual address space of a single process into segments that may be placed in non-contiguous areas of physical memory. 
 

 Memory allocation is the process of reserving a partial or complete portion of computer memory for the execution of programs and processes.


 We have already studied First Fit, Worst Fit and Best fit algorithms in class.
 
 We identify some new algorithms like Buddy Fit, Last Fit, Indexed Fit, Slab fit and Next-Fit.
